## Installation

# Clone the repository

# Compile the project
make

```

## Usage

Run game server:

```bash
./GS ##[-p GSport] [-v],
```
where:
GSport is the well-known port where the GS server accepts requests, both
in UDP and TCP. This is an optional argument. If omitted, it assumes the
value 58013.

If the â€“v option is set when invoking the program, it operates in verbose mode, meaning
that the GS outputs to the screen a short description of the received requests

Run game client:

```bash
./player ##[-n GSIP] [-p GSport]
```
where:
GSIP is the IP address of the machine where the game server (GS) runs.
This is an optional argument. If this argument is omitted, the GS should be
running on the same machine.

GSport
is the well-known port where the GS accepts requests. This is an optional argument. If omitted, it assumes the value
580013.
